# Big-Data-Project
For the project of Big Data, by Thomas Zwetyenga.
I made this project as a student on March 2018.

Help to find best appartments depeding on various criteria (region, pollution, price...) and with real-time RSS feed.

The final version uploaded a bit after is better

The "améliorée" version adds the appartments from the RSS feed direclty to the cities dataframe
